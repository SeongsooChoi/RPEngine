Purpose\r\n\r\n\t1.1. Education for engine development.\r\n\t This engine is based on Cyclone Engine(\"Ian Millington, Game Physics Engine Development\").\r\n\t And this project also aiming to be an easy way to start your engine development.\r\n\r\n\t1.2. Real simulation and also game.\r\n\t This engine should provide accuracy for real simulation and also proximate simulation(for game).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Features\r\n\t2.1. Supply for Plugged-in third party projects.\r\n\t We hope you to make some frameworks providing an easy way to implement dynamics to any application based on this RPEngine so user can implement dynamics without any physical domain knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.
