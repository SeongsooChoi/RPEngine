# RPEngine 1.3d_ver 2015.06.04


 3D Rigidbody Physics Engine.
 Collision-based, CPU core based(Not GPU version)

1. Purpose

	1.1. Education for engine development.
	 This engine is based on Cyclone Engine("Ian Millington, Game Engine Development").
	 And this project also aiming to be an easy way to start your engine development.

	1.2. Real simulation and also gaming.
	 This engine should provide accuracy for real simulation version and also proximate simulation(game)


2. Features
	2.1. Supply for Plugged-in third party projects.
	 We hope you to make some frameworks providing an easy way to implement dynamics to any application based on this RPEngine so user can implement dynamics without any physical domain knowledge.
