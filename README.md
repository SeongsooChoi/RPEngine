# RPEngine 1.04r 2015.08.05


 3D Rigidbody Physics Engine.
 Collision-based, CPU core based(Not GPU version)

1. Purpose

	1.1. Education for engine development.

	 This engine is based on Cyclone Engine("Ian Millington, Game Physics Engine Development").

	 And this project also aiming to be an easy way to start your engine development.

	1.2. Real simulation and also game.

	 This engine should provide accuracy for real simulation and also proximate simulation(for game).


2. Features

	2.1. Supply for Plugged-in third party projects.

	 We hope you to make some frameworks providing an easy way to implement dynamics to any application based on this RPEngine so user can implement dynamics without any physical domain knowledge.

[2015.08.05] RPEngine 1.04release

- Physics solver's FPS stability has been improved. but it should have a faster FPS recovery system.

- You can build up the project now.


[2015.06.15] RPEngine 1.03debug

- Uploading all of Source code has finished, but you shouldn't be able to build by itself.


[2015.06.04] RPEngine first uploaded.
